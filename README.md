# Windows 10 LTSC Guide
 This is a guide on how to install, activate, and get rid of telemetry on windows 10 LTSC Enterprise or IoT
# Download The ISO
First thing's first, you need to download the iso file for Windows 10 LTSC, this is something you won't find directly from Microsoft. Don't be fooled though, it is an official ISO, it's just the build on their site is outdated.
Download your respective iso [here](https://stuff.mtt-m1.workers.dev/Windows%2010/Windows%2010%20Enterprise%20LTSC%202021/).
# Creating a USB
Now using our ISO, we can create a USB with the installation files on it. We cannot modify the ISO until the files are on the USB (unless you want a bunch of pain in suffering ;) ). To do this, my tool of choice is Rufus. You can download a copy of Rufus from [rufus.ie](https://rufus.ie). Once you have rufus downloaded, open it as an administrator (I'm assuming you know how to do that if you're reading this guide, if not, you're shit outta luck). At the top where it shows select ISO, choose our Windows 10 LTSC ISO. Then hit start, for most people the defaults will be more than sufficient.
